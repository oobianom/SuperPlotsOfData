SuperPlotsofData is an advanced data visualization application that focuses on transparent data presentation. Its key features include identifying and summarizing replicas with colorblind-friendly colors and symbols, communicating experimental design details, and enabling raincloud plots to display data distribution. The app calculates effect sizes and p-values for quantitative condition comparisons. Unlike classical plots, SuperPlots distinguish between technical and biological replicates, offering a clearer view of data variability. The application combines the SuperPlots concept with the philosophy of PlotsOfData, enhancing transparency and interpretation by emphasizing raw data over summaries. Users can control the visibility of raw data and statistics through transparency adjustments. SuperPlotsOfData is tailored for replicates identification and analysis, making it a valuable tool for comparing conditions and displaying various sources of variability in experimental data.
